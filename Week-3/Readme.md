Sure! Here's the overview without any tables, explained in clean points:



### 🌐 **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**

* HTTP is the protocol used for communication between a client (like a browser or mobile app) and a web server.
* It works using a **request-response model**: the client sends a request, and the server responds.
* Common HTTP methods include:

  * `GET` – Fetches data (e.g., retrieve user info)
  * `POST` – Submits data (e.g., create a new user)
  * `PUT` – Updates existing data (replaces entire resource)
  * `PATCH` – Partially updates a resource
  * `DELETE` – Deletes a resource
* HTTP is stateless by default, meaning each request is independent.



### 🔁 **RESTful APIs**

* REST (Representational State Transfer) is a **design principle** for building APIs using HTTP.
* A RESTful API treats everything as a **resource** (like users, products, posts).
* Each resource is accessed using a **unique URL**. For example: `/api/users/1`.
* The type of operation on the resource is determined by the HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.).
* REST principles:

  * Stateless: Each request contains all information needed to process it.
  * Uniform Interface: Consistent structure for endpoints and actions.
  * Client-Server Separation: Frontend and backend are decoupled.
  * Cacheable: Responses can be cached to improve performance.
  * Layered System: APIs can be behind gateways, load balancers, etc.

### 📊 **HTTP Status Codes Overview**

* **200 OK** – The request was successful, and the server returned the expected response.
* **201 Created** – A new resource was created successfully (usually after a POST request).
* **204 No Content** – The request was successful, but there's no content to return.
* **400 Bad Request** – The client sent invalid data (e.g., missing required fields).
* **401 Unauthorized** – Authentication is required or the token is missing/invalid.
* **403 Forbidden** – The user is authenticated but doesn’t have permission.
* **404 Not Found** – The requested resource does not exist.
* **409 Conflict** – There’s a conflict, such as trying to create a duplicate record.
* **500 Internal Server Error** – Something went wrong on the server.
* **503 Service Unavailable** – The server is temporarily overloaded or under maintenance.
